For member who want to learn more about python

> Roadmap for python
> - https://roadmap.sh/python

## Setup enviroment
1. Install Python<br>
Step1: Click [download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install a stable version of Python as you want (we chose the Python 3.10 version)<br>
Step2: Run Executable Installer and make sure to select both the checkboxes (Install launcher... && Add Python PATH)<br>
Step3: Verify Python is installed on Windows<br>
    - Open the command prompt.
    - Type ```python --version```
    - Check the version of python which you have installed (it will be displayed if the python is successfully installed on your windows)

2. Install IDEs and Code Editors<br>
> An IDE (or Integrated Development Environment) is a program dedicated to software development. As the name implies, IDEs integrate several tools specifically designed for software development. <br>
> In contrast, a dedicated code editor can be as simple as a text editor with syntax highlighting and code formatting capabilities. Most good code editors can execute code and control a debugger.

â€»I want to suggest Visual Studio Code but you can use anything you want. Let's see below:
